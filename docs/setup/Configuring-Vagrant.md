## Vagrant Installation
You will need to configure Vagrant on your computer. To this this you should [download](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) the vagrant package relative to your system and install as you normally would.

#### Vagrant configuration

After you have installed the latest version of Vagrant, [setup this repository](Setting-Up-This-Repository) and [installed Ansible](Installing-Ansible) you need to configure some settings in order for Vagrant to work.

#### Installing

If you haven't already, run the install script:-

```bash
./ansible/install/bin/install.sh
```

This will create some initial files for you to work with and to begin configuring.

#### Role

You can find all the information for the various configuration options for the Vagrant Role [here](../roles/Vagrant.md)
